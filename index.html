<h2>The Taranova Moon Project</h2>

<p>Taranova Moon aims to craft a dynamic simulation where AI-driven agents autonomously develop and orchestrate a thriving society. Through this endeavor, we aspire to gain profound insights into AI behavior, the complexities of real-world simulations, and the converging realms of AI and the Metaverse.</p>

<h2>Generative Agents</h2>

<p>Within the Taranova Moon framework, we harness the power of generative AI agents, each designed with distinct attributes and behaviors. These agents will not only simulate individual roles but will also evolve and adapt to their surroundings. 
    
This is inspired by a groundbreaking Stanford study from 2023 on Generative Agents.

<p><img src="img/generative_agents.png" width="500" /></p>

As they interact, trade, and make decisions, the generative AI will continuously refine their characteristics, mimicking the dynamic nature of real-world economies. Our endeavor offers a deep dive into understanding the potential and complexities of AI-driven societies.</p>

<h2>The Metaverse</h2>

<p>Envisioning a grander scale for Taranova Moon, we anticipate expanding our simulation into the dynamic realm of the metaverse. This would enable our AI agents to interact in richer, immersive environments, bridging the gap between simulated economies and virtual realities. By integrating with the metaverse, Taranova Moon aims to pioneer a new frontier where AI-driven societies can flourish, offering invaluable insights into the potential intersections of AI and virtual worlds.</p>
