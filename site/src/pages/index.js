          <h2>Taraxa Announces $10M Grant Program to Build on BlockDAG!</h2>
          <p>Feb 5, 2023 -  The Taraxa Protocol Foundation has launched a $10 million Grant Program to drive growth in Taraxaâ€™s unique EVM-compatible blockDAG Layer-1 ecosystem. The Taraxa Grant Program is open to any individual, team, and organizations of any type. Funds will be granted specifically for technical development with an emphasis on driving usage and growth within the Taraxa ecosystem, and are disbursed according to quantifiable milestones.</p>

          <h2>Who is using BlockDAG?</h2>
          <h3>Taraxa</h3>
          <p><a href="https://taraxa.io">Taraxa BlockDAG</a>  - Taraxa is the first modern blockchain project to take advantage of BlockDAG. Founded in 2018, with years of research and a meticulous refactoring of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to takes advantage of BlockDAG while maintaining compatibility with popular Dapp structures and tooling. Taraxa is a Layer 1 solution that aims to enable Web3 to solve real world decentralization problems.</p>

          <h2>DAG - Directed Acyclic Graph</h2>
          <p>A DAG is just a simple mathematical structure, no more important to the BlockDAG than the concept of a chain is to the blockchain. Its nodes are connected, each having a known predecessor, without looping or cycling backwards. Unlike a chain where one node exists at a time, in a DAG, multiple nodes can form simultaneously from the same parent.</p>
          <p>The magic in BlockDAG exists in how these nodes (or blocks in this case) are ordered and executed.</p>

          <h2>Blockchains, DAGs and BlockDAGs</h2>
          <p>BlockDAG allows multiple blocks to be added to the network simultaneously, significantly increasing transaction throughput compared to the single-chain approach in traditional blockchains. The parallel nature of BlockDAG provides better scalability, handling more transactions per second (TPS) as the network grows, compared to the linear growth limitations of traditional blockchains. BlockDAG's structure can potentially offer improved security. The interconnectedness of blocks makes it more challenging for malicious actors to alter the transaction history.</p>
          <p>DAGs have been used for a long time in crypto projects (for example IOTA). Typically though, the transactions themselves are linked in a DAG structure, with each transaction needing to validate the previous ones. BlockDAG's use of traditional blocks provides advantages in scalability, security, and confirmation times.</p>
